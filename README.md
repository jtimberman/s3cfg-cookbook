# s3cfg Cookbook

This cookbook provides a resource, `s3cfg` that can be used to manage
`.s3cfg` configuration files for s3cmd.

http://s3tools.org/

## Requirements

## Attributes

* `node['s3cfg']['config']` - hash of s3cfg configuration options and
  their values.

## Resource: s3cfg

The `s3cfg` resource can be used to render a `.s3cfg` config file in
the specified location.

### Actions

The allowed actions are passed to a `template` resource rendered at
the path specified by the name or path attribute.

* `:create` - Default
* `:delete`
* `:create_if_missing`

### Attributes

* `path` - path to the s3cfg file to render
* `access_key` - AWS access key id
* `secret_key` - AWS secret access key
* `access_token` - AWS security token
* `host_bucket` - Override the default bucket name. Should be the full
  FQDN, e.g., `mybucket.s3.amazonaws.com`.
* `install_s3cmd` - Whether the `s3cmd` package should be installed.
  The default package manager must be able to install a package named `s3cmd`.
* `backup` - passed to the `backup` attribute of the template, default `5`
* `group` - passed to the `group` attribute of the template, default
  `nil` (group will be the group of the user running Chef)
* `mode` - passed to the `mode` attribute of the template, default
  `00600` (read only by owner)
* `owner` - passed to the `owner` attribute of the template, default
  `nil` (owner will be the user running Chef)
* `cookbook` - passed to the `cookbook` attribute of the template,
  default `s3cfg`
* `source` - passed to the `source` attribute of the template, default `s3cfg.erb`
* `config` - Hash of configuration overrides that will be merged with
  the `node['s3cfg']['config']` attributes to dynamically render in
  `s3cfg.erb`. Note that `access_key`, `secret_key`, `access_token` and
  `host_bucket` are added to this.

## Usage

Use the resource in your *own* cookbooks' recipes where applicable. Be
sure to set a dependency in your cookbook on this cookbook, in the
metadata e.g.:

```ruby
depends "s3cfg"
```

If you're using chef-vault for storing AWS secrets (see example
below), also depend on it:

```ruby
depends "chef-vault"
```

To render a config file for the root user, but don't install s3cmd:

```ruby
s3cfg "/root/.s3cfg" do
  access_key "Don't put secrets in recipes..."
  secret_key "Use chef-vault for that instead."
  install_s3cmd false
end
```

To use chef-vault to load an AWS item, and ensure that the s3cmd
package is installed:

```ruby
include_recipe "chef-vault"
aws_creds = chef_vault_item("vault", "aws-credentials")["data"]
s3cfg "/root/.s3cfg" do
  access_key aws_creds['aws_access_key_id']
  secret_key aws_creds['aws_secret_access_key']
end
```
